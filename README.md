# Calculator

A working calculator in the browser! Supports keyboard inputs.

This project was part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and was the final hands-on project as part of its Foundations course.

My main takeaway from this project was learning how CSS flexboxes work. Prior to this I was only really familar block, inline-block, and grid when it came to display options.
